# 0.1.4

Added more init scripts. 
The cookbook now officially supports the latest versions of debian, ubuntu, and centos.
Support for suse has been added, but is untested, so use with caution.
Support for fedora and other systemd platforms is existent, but incomplete.

The current systemd script doesn't work yet. 
If someone knows what I'm doing wrong, please contribute! :)
